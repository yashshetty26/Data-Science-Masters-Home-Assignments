# ## In Python / Stands For:
# ### The / symbol in python stands for doing the division operation.
# #### For Example:

# In[12]:


24/6


# ## In Python % Stands For:
# ### The % symbol in Python is called the Modulo Operator. It returns the remainder of a division opearation.
# #### For Example:
# 

# In[13]:


27%6


# ## In Python // Stands For:
# ### The // symbol in Python is called the Floor Division Operator. Floor division is a normal division operation except that it returns the largest possible integer.
# #### For Example:

# In[14]:


26//5


# ## In Python ** Stands For:
# ### The ** symbol in Python is called the Exponential Operator. Exponents is an operator which displays the operation of numerical powers.
# #### For Example:
# 

# In[15]:


12**2

# ## Mutable Objects
# ### Mutable objects are those that allow you to change their value or data in place without affecting the object's identity. 
# 
# ## Immutable Objects
# ### In contrast, immutable objects don't allow this kind of operation. You'll just have the option of creating new objects of the same type with different values.
